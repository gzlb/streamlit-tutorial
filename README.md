# S&P 500 Dashboard


## Overview

This is a simple S&P 500 Dashboard, created as a demonstration of Streamlit. It provides insights into the stock market by allowing users to explore and interact with S&P 500 data.

### Getting Started

To get started, simply navigate through the options available in the sidebar.

## Navigation

### 1. Ranking

In the "Ranking" section, users can obtain a ranking of the best-performing stocks based on market capitalization. Users can specify the number of stocks to display.

### 2. Plotting

In the "Plotting" section, users can visualize the data from the ranking in a plotted format over time. This allows for a better understanding of how the top-performing stocks have evolved.

### 3. Feedback

The "Feedback" section provides users with the opportunity to provide feedback, report issues, or share their preferences. Your feedback is valuable in improving the dashboard.

## Usage

To run the Streamlit app locally, make sure you have Streamlit installed. You can install it via pip:

## Setting Up a Virtual Environment (venv)

It is recommended to use a virtual environment to isolate your project's dependencies. This ensures that the packages required for your project do not conflict with other Python projects on your system. Here's how to set up and activate a virtual environment for this project:



### Creating a Virtual Environment

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the root directory of your project.

3. Run the following command to create a virtual environment named "venv" (you can choose a different name if you prefer):

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv

4. Read the requirements.txt file to install the necessary packages 
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt


Note: initially I was hoping to use a pytoml file but this is not supported on the Streamlit cloud.
